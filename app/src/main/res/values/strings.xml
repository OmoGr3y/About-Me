    <string name="bio">"Hannibal's full name was Hannibal
        Barca. Hannibal means 'joy of Baal.' Barca means 'lightning'.
        Barca is also spelled Barcas, Barca, and Barak. Hannibal was a son of Hamilcar Barca (d.228 BCE), the military leader of Carthage during the First Punic War in which he was defeated in 241 BCE Hamilcar developed a base for Carthage in southern Spain, which helps explain the geography and transalpine adventure of the Second Punic War. When Hamilcar died, his son-in-law Hasdrubal took over, but when Hasdrubal died, 7 years later, in 221, the army-appointed Hannibal general of the forces of Carthage in Spain.â€‹ .In the 184 BCE battle between King Eumenes II of Pergamon (r. 197-159 BCE) and King Prusias I of Bithynia in Asia Minor (c.228-182 BCE), Hannibal served as commander of the Bithynian fleet. Hannibal used catapults to hurl pots filled with poisonous snakes into the enemy ships. The Pergamese panicked and fled, allowing the Bithynians to win.Hannibal retained his reputation as a formidable opponent and great military leader even after Carthage lost the Punic Wars. Hannibal colors the popular imagination because of his treacherous trek with elephants across the Alps to face the Roman army. By the time the Carthaginian troops had finished the mountain crossing, he had about 50,000 troops and 6000 horsemen with which to face and defeat the Romans 200,000.
        Although Hannibal ultimately lost the war, he managed to survive in enemy land, winning battles for 15 years."</string>
